# Jet-Engine-Simulation-using-ESP32-
This IoT project uses an ESP32-WROOM-32 to simulate a jet engine environment. It monitors temperature, humidity, air quality, and flame detection using various sensors. A BLDC motor simulates the engine, controlled via a WebSocket-based dashboard. Data is visualized in real-time on a standalone web interface served by the ESP32.
